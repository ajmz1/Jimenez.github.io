      <p>
        I am a petroleum engineering student pursuing a Master of Science degree at
        Texas A&M University. Current research is being conducted with 
        <a href="https://engineering.tamu.edu/petroleum/profiles/tblasingame.html"
          >Dr. Thomas A. Blasingame</a
        >
        as advisor and committee chair.

        My academic interests are related to physics of fluid flow through porous media
        and their applications to reservoir development. Inspired by the classical works
        published by 
        <a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Flow_of_Homogeneous_Fluids_Through_P.html?id=flNUAAAAMAAJ"

        I aim to develop analytical solutions applicable to our current oil and gas industry.

        Having no programming experience until beginning my engineering degree, I understand
        the distress students may face when first viewing a blank programming interface.
        Initially contrived to teach my sister programming, I have written scripts for 
        engineering applications that illustrate its practicality and usefulness.

        It is my hope that the
        <a href="http://www.fa-jimenez.com/projects"
           >projects</a
        >
        outlined on this page enable and inspire others to learn programming too.

      <h2>Research and Publications</h2>
      <h5>Pressure Transient Analysis in Shales</h5>
      <p>
        <i>(ongoing work)</i>&nbsp PTA's rigor is brought to the forefront when analyzing dense
        data sets of pressure buildups as a result of well shut-ins. With fewer long-term
        shut-ins planned, PTA may not be seen in the same light as it used to. However, 
        with unconventional plays taking off and wells being drilled closer together, there
        is still great value in PTA. This work aims to review classical approaches,
        detail new advancements, and provide exhaustive recommendations for engineers and reservoir development.

      <h5>Energy Resources And Their Impact On The United States Energy Profile &mdash; SPE-201800-MS</h5>
      <p>
        <i>(being published)</i>&nbsp The objective of this work is to raise awareness of the historical
        energy profile of the United States as it begins a period of "distinctive transformation" to renewable
        (wind and solar) and zero-carbon (nuclear and hydroelectric) energy sources. Continuously
        increasing energy requirements for the United States make such studies essential, and while
        we acknowledge a transition to non-fossil energy sources, we recognize that fossil energy,
        in particular, oil and gas, will continue to have a dominant role (particularly natural gas).

        Here I will link some of my recent works with a brief description. For full list of projects

      <h5>Real vs. "Fake" Gases in O&G</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>(in revision)</i>&nbsp Comprehension of hydrocarbon chemistry is key to successfully produce oil and gas.
          This article reviews important history and usage of the gas compressibility factor (Z-Factor).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h5>Back to the Basics: The Liquid Diffusivity Equation</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i><a href="http://www.fa-jimenez.com/assets/projects/01_Liq_Diffus_Eqn.pdf">(link)<</i>&nbsp Sure, oil price is important. However, first you have to produce it from 1000s of
          feet below surface. Let's review how 3 "simple" equations describe the physics of fluid flow through
          porous media.
