      Sure, oil price is important. However, first you have to produce it from
      1000s of feet below surface. 
      This was one of my first fun programming projects, a visual experiment of
      simulating gravity in a system with hundreds of interacting planets. The
      calculations are done with simple physics formulas, with a bit of tweaking
      and damping to make them more robust. Clicking adds an invisible mass that
      makes all objects move towards the cursor. Everything is rendered on a
      <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> element, and it's quite satisfying to move the
      colorful balls around!
