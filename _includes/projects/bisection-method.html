    <p>
      In practical scenarios where functions may be very complex, analytically solving for
      a root value is not feasible, or at the very least, very computationally exhaustive.
      In these cases, numerical methods can be useful. Bisection algorithm is one of the
      most general methods for root finding, but as the Jupyter notebook shows, there may
      be trouble converging on a root at later iteration levels.
